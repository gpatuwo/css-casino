CSS Casino
===================

## Background
CSS Casino is a site that demos casino-themed animations using only HTML and CSS.

## MVP

With CSS Casino, users will be able to:

- [ ] Scroll through a single-page app to see cool effects that can be implemented using only HTML/CSS
- [ ] Hover over the graphics to activate the animations
- [ ] Show the source code for that animation

## Wireframe
As a whole, this single-page app will contain at least 3 effect categories (each of which will animate upon hover). Inside the effect sections, there will also be a 'view source' button that will reveal the source code for those effects.

At the top of the page, it will have an animation of CSS Casino in neon lettering that flashes subtly. This header will also contain a brief one-liner explaining the purpose of this site as well as links to the Github source code and my LinkedIn page.
